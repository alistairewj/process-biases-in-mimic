# Conclusion for reproduction

The following is a logbook/ultimate conclusion for a reproduction of a published scientific study. Feel free to add/remove sections as you find them useful.

## Title

The title of the reproduced study with its digital object identifier (DOI).

## Known differences

Specify changes to the data processing and/or methodology which are known to you. For each difference, describe: (1) the original study approach, (2) the reproduction approach, (3) the justification for the change. If possible, classify the differences as major (could impact the result of the study) or minor (unlikely to change the result of the study).

- Timing of Mortality
    - Original approach: 3 or 4 years from hospital admission or discharge (not clear)
    - Reproduction approach: 1 year from hospital discharge
    - Mortality data is only available up to 1 year from hospital discharge in MIMIC-IV.
- Day of week is unavailable
    - Original approach: Evaluate day of week
    - Reproduction approach: N/A
    - Justification: Day of week is not available in MIMIC-IV.
- Cohort duration
    - Original approach: 5 years of data, last year defines cohort
    - Reproduction approach: 6 years of data, last year defines cohort
    - Justification: MIMIC-IV separates data into 3 year blocks.

## Unknown differences

Specify changes to the data processing and/or methodology which *may* have occurred, but you are unable to confirm due to ambiguity in the original material studied. For each difference, describe (1) the most specific reference to the approach in the original study, if possible, and (2) the approach taken in the reproduction.

- Multiple encounters
    - It is not clear how multiple encounters were handled.
- Cohort subset
    - It is unclear how a clinical encounter was defined.

## Comparison of population

## Comparison of results

A table of the evaluation measures comparing the results in the original study and the reproduction. Also include the final size of the cohort, proportion of individuals excluded, and other important summary measures for the study.
